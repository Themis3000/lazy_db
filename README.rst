A lazily loaded key:value db intended for use with large datasets that are too big to be loaded into memory. The database supports integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries. There may be future support for raw bytes as well. This database is meant to strike a good balance of retrieval/insertion speed and memory usage.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: python
    from lazy_db import LazyDb

    db = LazyDb("test.lazy")
    db.write("test_value", "value")
    print(db.read("test_value"))  # prints "value"
    db.close()
This is in very early stages of development right now. Here are changes planned in the future:

* Clean up code so that centralized functions for conversions are more often used (code cleanup)
* Make content ints unsigned (space optimization)
* Attend to files generated by cookiecutter; release on pypi (release)
* Implement lists (feature)
* Optimize dictionaries so they aren't stored as json strings (optimization)
* Implement removing entries (feature)
* Implement raw bytes support (feature)
